# CS6008 Data Structures and Algorithms

In this course, you will find multiple assignments that showcase Arjun's ability to code in C. His notable work can be found in each assignment, and there are also labs that showcase more of his skills.

## Assignment 1

**Summary:** This assignment involved the implementation of three separate functions in C: Print Victory, Print Rectangles, and Print Fancy Rectangles.

**Skills Highlighted:**
- C Programming
- Function Implementation
- User Input Handling
- Loop Structures
- Problem Solving
- Version Control (GitHub)

## Assignment 2

**Summary:** This assignment focused on implementing various functions using structs and pointers in C.

**Skills Highlighted:**
- C Programming
- Structs and Pointers
- Error Detection
- Testing in C
- Makefiles

## Assignment 3

**Objective:** Implement various functions in C for Assignment 3 for a linked list.

**Skills Highlighted:**
- C Programming
- Linked List Operations
- Sorting Algorithms (Selection Sort, Quicksort)
- Memory Allocation and Deallocation
- Test File Implementation
- Debugging and Troubleshooting
- Algorithm Complexity Analysis

## Assignment 4

**Objective:** Implement various functions in C for Assignment 4. In Assignment 4, I implemented various functions for doubly-linked lists and a Deque in C. The assignment provided an opportunity to reinforce my understanding of linked lists and apply it to a practical problem. The most challenging part was managing the pointers and updating nodes correctly, especially when inserting or removing elements at specific positions. The assignment helped me improve my skills in linked list manipulation and problem-solving. However, more detailed instructions and guidance would have been beneficial.

**Files and Functions Implemented:**
- linkedlist.h: Header file for all the functions.
- Struct for ll_node and ll_head.
- Part 1 functions: addLeft, addRight, removeLeft, removeRight, insertAt, hasValue, and more.
- Part 2 functions for Deque: pushLeft, peekLeft, popLeft, pushRight, peekRight, and popRight.

**Skills Highlighted:**
- C Programming
- Doubly-Linked List Operations
- Deque Implementation
- Memory Allocation and Deallocation
- Test File Implementation
- Debugging and Troubleshooting
- Linked List Data Manipulation
- Algorithm Complexity Analysis

## Assignment 5

**Objective:** Implement a simple shell program with four built-in commands: cd, help, exit, and game. Assignment 5 involved creating a simple shell program with four built-in commands. The cd command changes the directory, help prints available functions, exit exits the program, and game offers a number guessing game. The assignment helped me improve my shell programming skills and gain experience with system calls and user input handling.

**Skills Highlighted:**
- Shell Programming
- System Calls (chdir, execve, exit)
- User Input Handling
- Control Structures (while loop)
- Random Number Generation
- Conditional Statements
- Game Development
- Interactive User Experience

## Assignment 7

**Objective:** Implement a program that utilizes a hash map to store anagrams of specific words. The program allows users to input words, searches for anagrams, and stores them in a hash map. This program accepts user input, searches for it in a text file, and stores the input as a key along with a list of generated anagrams in a hash map. As the user enters more data, the hash map grows. If the user reenters old input, the program retrieves the information from the hash map rather than iterating through the text file.

**Skills Learned:**
- Working with hash maps.
- Handling larger datasets.
- Dealing with mallocing and pointers.
- Debugging issues related to memory and pointers.
- Flexibility in implementing hash maps in multiple ways.

## Assignment 8

**Objective:** Create a program that reads a file using multiple threads for analysis.

**Summary:** This directory contains code to read a file using multiple threads. It includes files like mt_search.c, example.c, Makefile.c, and README.md. The program allows you to compile and run different input scenarios to analyze text files using multiple threads.

**Skills Learned:**
- Working with multiple threads in C.
- Using global variables to communicate between threads.
- Handling thread creation and synchronization.
- Debugging multithreaded programs.
- Command-line argument handling in C.
