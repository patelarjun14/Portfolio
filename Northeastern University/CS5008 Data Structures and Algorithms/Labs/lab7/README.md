Who did you work with (if anyone)
N/a

How long did this take you? 
3 hours

What "bells and whistles" did you implement as part of your script?
Mine did not have any bells or whistles (not entirely sure what you mean by this).
My implemnetation for my script allows a user to copy the class repo in the 
current repo they are in then gives them the option to add files to their
own repo

What did you like about this lab? 
I think creating a bash shell script is very useful for commands
such as the git commands

What could be improved about this lab? 
I think going more indepth of the coding language for creating a 
bash shell would have been more helpful. For some reason, my code
did not work with the given code within hte presentation. I tried multiple
of them and it did not work for me. I would suggest taking a closer look
on what errors students might run into and how to trouble shoot any problems.
