Files created in assignment:
README.MD: This has the summary of the assignment
Makefile: This file was used for testing
pointers.c: This file was used for practice
a2.c: This has all the real code
a2.h: This is the header file that creates the struct for Name
a2_test.c: This is the test file


Summary:
This assignment was good in that we learned a lot about structs 
and being able to break down pointers. The most dificult part of this
assigment was catching errors and making sure everything was typed in correctly.
The smallest mistakes (even when no erros were being printed) made this 
assignment extremely difficult.
