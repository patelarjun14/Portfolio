# CS5100 Foundations of Artificial Intelligence

In this course, Arjun Patel demonstrated proficiency through a series of assignments that highlight his noteworthy contributions and skills in the field of Artificial Intelligence.

## Assignment Baseball

**Summary:**  
Arjun's work in this assignment involved utilizing Prolog to construct the starting lineup for an all-star version of the Seattle Mariners, adhering to specific constraints. The challenge required the selection of nine players from a pool of candidates with varying statistics, such as batting average, runs batted in, home runs, earned run average, and batting handedness. The assignment focused on leveraging constraint programming, logical puzzle-solving, and rule-based decision-making to formulate an optimal lineup.

**Skills Learned:**
- **Constraint Programming:** Applying constraints to make strategic decisions.
- **Logical Puzzle Solving:** Employing Prolog to solve intricate logical puzzles.
- **Translating English Constraints into Prolog:** Converting English constraints into a Prolog program.
- **Prolog List Manipulation:** Manipulating lists in Prolog to represent data.
- **Rule-Based Decision Making:** Formulating rules and constraints to guide decision-making in Prolog.

## Assignment Boba

**Summary:**  
Arjun excelled in creating a text-based boba ordering system for a bubble tea shop in this assignment. Customers could place orders using natural language requests, engaging in a dialogue with the system to clarify details and receive complete order summaries. The primary focus was on natural language processing, designing a menu with various drink options and customizations, and implementing order logic and exception handling.

**Skills Learned:**
- **Natural Language Processing:** Developing a system capable of understanding and processing natural language inputs.
- **Dialog Systems:** Building a text-based dialogue system for customer interactions.
- **Menu Design:** Crafting a menu featuring diverse drink options, ingredients, and customization choices.
- **Order Logic:** Implementing the logic necessary to process customer orders based on their preferences and addressing missing details.
- **Exception Handling:** Managing exceptional cases where customers provide incomplete or ambiguous orders.

## Assignment Trains

**Summary:**  
In the context of this assignment, Arjun showcased proficiency in working with Prolog, particularly SWI-Prolog, to define predicates and establish relationships related to train routes. The objective revolved around creating a knowledge base representing train links from north to south for the Seattle Light Rail and Amtrak Cascades. This entailed defining predicates such as link, north, and connected. The assignment also involved reflecting on Prolog's unique features and comparing them to iterative programming languages like Java or Python.

**Skills Learned:**
- **Prolog Programming:** Creating Prolog predicates and knowledge bases.
- **Predicates and Relationships:** Defining relationships between train stations.
- **Logical Programming:** Operating within Prolog's logic-based programming paradigm.
- **Reflection:** Analyzing and reflecting upon the characteristics and challenges of Prolog in contrast to iterative programming languages like Java or Python.

## Final Project

**Summary:**  
For the CS5100 Final Project, Arjun demonstrated advanced capabilities in machine learning by conducting a comprehensive analysis of a dataset, extracting valuable insights, and presenting data visualizations. The project encompassed the application of multiple machine learning methods, performance comparison, model optimization, documentation, and a succinct presentation to the class. Arjun's final project involved the creation of an AI model for stock market analysis and trading on SPY.

**Skills Learned:**
- **Machine Learning:** Proficiency in applying machine learning techniques to analyze data.
- **Data Analysis:** Skill in exploring, processing, and deriving insights from datasets.
- **Model Comparison:** Ability to evaluate and compare the performance of diverse machine learning models.
- **Model Tuning:** Skill in optimizing machine learning models for enhanced results.
- **Data Visualization:** Competence in creating visually compelling data representations for effective communication.
- **Documentation:** Capability to provide comprehensive documentation within a Jupyter Notebook.
- **Presentation Skills:** Proficiency in delivering concise 3-5 minute presentations summarizing project objectives and findings.
