## Value Proposition

*Pleasant Pedal* is a web application designed for Seattle-based cyclists, catering to all skill levels, seeking optimal cycling experiences away from crowded trails. The application's core objectives include:

1. **Enhanced Planning Capabilities**: Providing cyclists with trail information and traffic data for informed route planning.
2. **Improved Safety on Shared Roads**: Offering realistic safety expectations based on crime data from trail neighborhoods.
3. **Promoting Healthy Exercise and Environmentally Friendly Transport**: Encouraging cycling for exercise and sustainable commuting.

## Data Analysis and Community Insight

The project's data analysis revealed valuable insights into the local biking community and target audience:

1. **Trail Popularity**: Myrtle Edwards to Elliot Bay Park (Beginner) is popular among pedestrians, while the I-90 Trail (Advanced) sees fewer pedestrians due to higher bike and car traffic.

2. **Seasonal Trends**: Peak biking seasons align with April-August, while crime rates peak between July-December. Weather fluctuations impact crime rates.

3. **Commuter-Friendly Neighborhoods**: Areas like Rainier Beach, Leschi, Sand Point, Capitol Hill, Ballard, and Fremont offer extensive transit and ground passenger services, with better-maintained bike infrastructure.

4. **Weather Impact**: Biking activity increases with higher temperatures, and rain doesn't significantly deter Seattle cyclists, possibly due to the region's frequent rainfall.



## Future Steps

The next phase involves exploring commercial opportunities, marketing to the target demographic, and conducting field research and focus testing. User-oriented features like community engagement tools and social networking integration will be developed to enhance the application's functionality and user base.
