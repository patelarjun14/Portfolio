3 hours

What did you like about this lab?
The problems are practical and teaches students more
about arrays.

What would you change about this lab?
Something I would add is adding more about char type
because the last problem was difficult in that 
we needed to convert the sentence (string) into an array, but since
they are characters, this becomes very dificult to convert
