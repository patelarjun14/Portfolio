Who did you work with (if anyone)?
N/A

How long did this take you?
2 hours (I was running out of time)

What did you like about this lab?
Testing is a crucial aspect of coding, which means being introduced
to it is important. Thats mainly why I like this lab.

What could be improved about this lab?
I think I would improve the directions because I am not sure if I got 
everything correct. Also I would maybe recommend people to come to
this lab because this seems to be a important topic and directions
for me seemed to be difficult to follow.
