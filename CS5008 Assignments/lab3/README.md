1. Who did you work with (if anyone)
I did this by myself

2. How long did this take you?
2 hours

3. What did you like about this lab?
I believe learning more about memory management problems like memory leaks
is a great thing to learn because it can slow down or stop programs from working

4. TWhat could be imprvoed about this lab?
The deliverable or what needs to be sumbitted is confusing. I would add a section
requesting students to submit their command prompt history to make sure they ran the 
programs or specify what needs to be submitted
