Who did you work with?
N/A

How long did it take you to complete the lab?
3 hours

What is something you liked about this lab?
I think it will be extremely useful to combine functions
from different files, which is what I really like 
about this lab

What is something that could be improved about this lab?
I had issues on step 7. For some reason, my file format 
was not recognizable. Since this is my first time running
gdp, it was extremely hard to understand what was wrong because
I had felt that I did everything that the lab instructed me to do.
I would add more instructions on step 7. Also towards the end,
it does not state to submit the 'gdb.txt' file. I have done 
so to show what was happening in my terminal
