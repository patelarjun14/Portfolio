who did you work with (if anyone)?
N/A

How long did this take you?
2 hours

Write a sentence or two about what file you chose to clean up, and note something about what the most common or annoying issue you had to fix. 
The file I fixed was from assignment a1. Something that was common was the white space after commas or using a space between commas, which was annoying.
I also found it interesting that this format style guide does not allow tab. Even though tab does indent the code further, I do believe
this makes coding much more efficient. I am not sure if there is a way to change it so that tab spaces out correctly. If there is a way, maybe including
it in the lab would be nice.

What did you like about this lab?
Getting to know a new style code is extremely help as having your code consistent is a necessary aspect in coding

What could be impoved about this lab?
This lab was perfect in introducing a new way for us to style our code. Only thing I would add is seeing if we can indent by the correct amount 
of spaces.
