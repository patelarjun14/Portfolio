TULSA, Okla., July 27, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- CLEAR YOU, the secure identity company, today announced it is launching its identity verification technology at Tulsa International Airport (TUL)'s Main Terminal, bringing frictionless and predictable travel experiences to Tulsa. CLEAR's launch at TUL is expected to create 25 jobs and generate approximately $1.2 million annually in local economic impact.

"We're thrilled to welcome CLEAR to Tulsa along with the customer experience they will offer to our passengers," said Andrew Pierini, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer at Tulsa International Airport. "CLEAR brings a cutting-edge amenity that allows passengers a smooth, expedited journey through airport security and we are excited to have them operating at TUL."
"CLEAR is on the side of the American traveler, and our lanes help make the journey as joyful as the destination," said CLEAR CEO Caryn Seidman-Becker. "We're excited to bring Tulsa's travelers the predictable, seamless, and safe airport experience they deserve."
Today's launch represents continued growth in CLEAR's national footprint, where it serves a total of 53 airports and over 16 million members. CLEAR already serves 9 of TUL's top 10 domestic destinations, allowing members traveling through TUL to use CLEAR on both ends of their journey. Members use CLEAR's network of dedicated lanes to verify their identity with their eyes or fingers, replacing the need to take out their wallet and driver's license. After verification, a CLEAR Ambassador escorts members through the dedicated lane and directly to TSA physical security, saving them time waiting in line at the security checkpoint.
CLEAR Plus an opt-in membership that provides access to CLEAR's expedited identity verification lanes costs about $16 a month billed annually, with discounts available for Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Alaska Airlines and American Express members. Newly enrolling active military, veterans, and government officials are also eligible for discounted memberships, and additional family members can be added to an existing CLEAR Plus account for just $70 per adult per year.
