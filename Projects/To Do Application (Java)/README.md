# TODO Application Readme

## Project Objectives:

### Code Integration:
Merge relevant code from Assignment 8 for command-line parsing and file handling.

### Modular Reuse:
Assess the modularity of Assignment 8's design to identify reusable classes.

### Code Adaptability:
Evaluate how well the original code adapts to the TODO application's requirements.

### Design Enhancement:
Make necessary codebase changes for improved functionality in the TODO application.

## Application Functionality:

The TODO application is a flexible and efficient task management system that empowers users with seamless task creation, editing, and deletion. Each task includes essential details such as title, description, and due date. Accessible through a command-line interface, the application prioritizes a user-friendly experience. Robust support for file operations ensures tasks can be read and written, guaranteeing data persistence between sessions. Inherited from Assignment 8, the modular design fosters code reuse and easy maintenance, contributing to an efficient and streamlined codebase. The application is designed to adapt to future enhancements, emphasizing both adaptability and efficiency for optimal task management.
