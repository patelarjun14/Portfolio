# Checkers Game

This is a implementation of a Checkers game in Python. It allows two players to take turns and make moves in a Checkers game on an 8x8 board.

## How to Run the Game

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.

2. Copy and paste the provided code into a Python file (e.g., `checkers_game.py`) using a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE).

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the Python file.

4. Run the game by running the file create_new.py (this is the most updated version)

## Improvments

1. Need to refine code (create more methods to reduce amount of code)
2. Need to implement double jump
3. Need to implement a better AI (make conditional moves or calculate best moves by probabilities)
